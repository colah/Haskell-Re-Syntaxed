Haskell Re-Syntaxed
===================

I love Haskell. But lately I've been wondering if Haskell might benefit from a sort of "Cofeescript for Haskell", a semantically equivalent language with improved syntax.

Haskell now has over a decade of use experience to reflect on in terms of what makes good syntax. And a lot of extensions have built on top of it since Haskell 98, often leading to quirky syntax once a bunch are enabled.

You can find some brainstorming about syntax improvements [here](Haskell-Re-Syntaxed/blob/master/brainstorm.hs). But before you look and bias yourself with my ideas, please take a moment to think about what your ideal Haskell syntax would change... Then fork and add to the brainstorm!
